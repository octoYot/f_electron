***FATAL: f-electron calculation and could not find file:"f_electron.dat" in directory:                    
Need a better message when F_E_PATH is not set

1. Cannot use BLOC & EXPL commands at same time as can get an N=0 error in some blocked matrices.
2. underflow when using EXPL command:
   Note: The following floating-point exceptions are signalling: IEEE_UNDERFLOW_FLAG IEEE_DENORMAL

6. on console: 
Transition matrix in basis:   0.41 secs
Calculating transitions:      5.42 secs

8. in experimental intensities number to identifiy if x,y,z,sum/3, and ED,MD,ED+MD

9. Output intensities & compare to experiment.

10. When listing energies in ED or MD intensity calculations, always relative 0, even if energies 
not requested to be E0=0. (OPTN(1)=F)


Bugs:

Short-term:
1) TODO: Plotoutput for spin & MJ for IRREPS
2) Allow JO parameters to be formula

Long-term/Hard:
1) PLOTfile output needs to be finished & tested.
2) Cannot use PREDiagonalisation during a fit.
3) Full intensity parameterisation needs to be finished & tested.

Long-term Maybe
1) Allow x,y,z coordinates to be formula
