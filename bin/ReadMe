The f_electron program is run at the command prompt in Windows.
f_e_32.exe is a 32bit executable compiled with gcc-6.3.0
f_e_64.exe is a 64bit executable compiled with gcc-12.2.0
Both should run under Win10 giving identical results with f_e_64 marginally faster.

The executable should be in the same folder as the data files: f_electron.dat, d_electron.dat, group.dat
An environment variable F_E_PATH should be defined as the directory where these files are.
To set this (assuming that the directory where these files are is c:\f_electron): 
>set F_E_PATH=c:\f_electron

You should then be able to run the program in any working directory. 
To run:
>f_e input output
